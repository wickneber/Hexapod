# Hexapod
Base code to get my PhantomX hexapod moving. This is a continuation from the other hexapod repository. My goal is to get my hexapod moving with natural gaits and movement and able to be ran on a Raspberry PI or Arduino and controlled by a game pad sending readings from a gamepad such as a Playstation 5 DualSense Controller. This is a work in progress. See below for a progress video.
